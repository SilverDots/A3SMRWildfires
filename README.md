# What is A3SMRWildires?
A3SMRWildfires is a narrative-driven web page which features a visualization of predominant man-made causes of U.S. wildfires. The visualization was written using the D3 Javascript library, and the rest of the page was composed from a mix of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The web page is viewable: [https://silverdots.github.io/A3SMRWildfires/](https://silverdots.github.io/A3SMRWildfires/)
